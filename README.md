## About:
While waiting for [Star Wars: The Force Awakens](Star Wars: The Force Awakens) to come out, the team at [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/) became interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. In particular, they wondered: **does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?**

The team needed to collect data addressing this question. To do this, they surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey. They received `835` total responses, which you download from their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey)

In this project, we will be cleaning and exploring thid dataset. Dataset is present as `star_Wars.csv`.
